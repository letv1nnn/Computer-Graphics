# Graphical C/C++ Apps
Welcome to a collection of **graphical applications in C++**, showcasing:
- **Algorithm visualizations**
- **2D game prototypes**
- Real-time graphics using **Raylib**, **OpenGL** and maybe more

This project is ideal for learning how to combine **core C++ logic** with **interactive visuals** using modern graphics libraries.
